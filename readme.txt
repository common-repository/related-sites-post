The Blog Traffic Exchange is a cutting edge cloud based service that is founded on the solid SEO principles that are already behind the architecture of many existing blog related posts plugins.

By using proprietary chaos and relevancy algorithms in conjunction with the Sphinx Open Source Full Text Index Engine, the Blog Traffic Exchange is able to effectively multiply the traffic of your blog by establishing a reader exchange with other members.

Operation of the plugin is simple.

After installing the plugin, your blog will auto install links to related posts from other member sites. These sites will be displayed at the end of your posts.

To see the plugin in action, please refer to the two blog posts on the Blog Traffic Exchange blog that demonstrate the Related Websites plugin: 

[Ultimate wealth](http://www.ultimate-iwealth.com/ "Ultimate wealth") and [HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE](http://www.blogform.co.cc/ "HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE")

All links are randomly rotated both locally per page load and globally every 24 hours. A proprietary traffic balancing algorithm rewards blogs those blogs sending the most diverse traffic into the exchange with more frequent placement. 

Anyone who installs the [Related Websites Traffic exchange](http://www.blogform.co.cc/wordpress-plugins/related-websites/ "Related Websites") plugin will notice the unique benefits it offers, but the plugin gets even better. 

 The plugin automatically automates a consistent balance of links in both directions without ever compromising relevancy to the reader. That is impressive in itself, but even more impressive than the technology is the price.
